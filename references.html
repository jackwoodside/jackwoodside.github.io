A certain number of protons (not more than three) and electrons can be bound to such an &alpha;-aggregate without forming a new &alpha;-particle. Such additional units of nuclear constitution, usually bound less strongly than those involved in the &alpha;-particles, we shall term free nuclear protons and electrons. Their presence will, of course, affect the form of the nuclear energy curve (mass defect curve), not changing, however, its general shape.</td>

The tabulations given by them indicate that spin orbit coupling favors the state of higher total angular momentum. If strong spin-orbit coupling, increasing with angular momentum, is assumed, a level assignment different from either Feenberg or Nordheim is obtained. This assignment encounters a very few contradictions with experimental facts and requires no major crossing of the levels from those of a square well potential. The magic numbers 50, 82, and 126 occur at the place of the spin-orbit splitting of levels of high angular momentum.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Recently there has been notable success, particularly by Maria Mayer, in explaining many nuclear phenomena including spins, magnetic moments, isomeric states, etc. on the basis of a single particle model for the separate nucleons in a spherical nucleus. The spherical model, however, seems incapable of explaining the observed large quadrupole moments of nuclei. In this paper it is shown that an extension of the logic of this model leads to the prediction that greater stability is obtained for a spheroidal than for a spherical nucleus of the same volume, when reasonable assumptions are made concerning the variation of the energy terms on distortion. The predicted quadrupole moment variation with odd A is in general agreement with the experimental values as concerns variation with A, but are even larger than the experimental values. Since the true situation probably involves considerable ``dilution'' of the extreme single particle model, it is encouraging that the present predictions are larger rather than smaller than the experimental results. A solution is given for the energy levels of a particle in a spheroidal box.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The individual particle model of nuclear structure fails to account for the observed large nuclear quadrupole moments. It is possible, however, to allow for the existence of the quadrupole moments, and still retain the essential features of the individual particle model, by assuming the average field in which the nucleons move to deviate from spherical symmetry. The assumptions underlying such an asymmetric nuclear model are discussed; this model implies, in particular, a quantization of angular momenta in analogy with molecular structure. The asymmetric model appears to account better than the extreme single particle model for empirical data regarding nuclear magnetic moments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The theory of the influence on angular correlations of perturbing interactions in the intermediate state is reformulated to allow the description of the effects of time-dependent as well as of static perturbations. For static interactions of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment with crystalline fields of axial symmetry in polycrystalline sources, attenuation factors are calculated for the coefficients of the various terms in the expansion of the correlation function in Legendre polynomials. No matter how strong the quadrupole interaction, some anisotropy must remain for polycrystalline sources but, for the same interaction in simple single crystals, the anisotropy can be either undisturbed or completely destroyed, depending on the orientation of the crystal. Fields of lower symmetry are shown also to leave, for polycrystalline sources, some anisotropy. Expressions for the influence of randomly fluctuating interactions, such as must exist in liquid sources, are calculated and these predict arbitrarily complete destruction of the correlation under certain conditions, but explain the more nearly unperturbed results usually found with such sources. For electronic shells having magnetic moments, the influences of electronic paramagnetic relaxation and of anisotropy of the hyperfine structure interaction are examined. An applied static magnetic field in the presence of static quadrupole interactions in polycrystalline sources is shown to have differing effects depending on the relative strengths of the two interactions. Application of a magnetic field directed toward a counter cannot reduce the disturbance of the intermediate state in liquid sources, except under special circumstances. The influences of an applied field in the presence of time dependent anisotropic hyperfine structure interactions are discussed. Finally, the feasibility of resonance experiments, for the precise determination of nuclear moments in the intermediate state, is explored.</td>

The de-excitation gamma rays from these levels to the ground states were detected except for Fe^57, where a 123-kev gamma ray is predominantly emitted. In addition, we have excited the 182-kev level in Zn^67, whose de-excitation takes place partly by cascade through the 92-kev first excited state. In the cases of F^19 and Na^23 we were able to compare directly the relative contributions of Coulomb excitation and compound nucleus formation by means of the (, p&gamma;) reactions taking place via the same compound nuclei. In all cases the excitation curves are in fair agreement with the theoretical E2 curves at the lower energies, but show definite deviations in the direction of too much excitation at the higher energies, pointing to some resonant compound-inelastic contribution as well as possible penetration effects not accounted for by the classical theory. The transition probabilities of all transitions are about one-tenth of those in the rare earth region.</td>

It is pointed out that these 2^+ levels may arise from the same configuration as the lower lying 0^+ states which are considered to be deformed. The degree of deformation is estimated from the 0^+-2^+ energy separation and found to correspond to quite high deformations in some cases. The 6.06-Mev, 0^+, pair emitting state in O^16, which is considered to be a ``hole configuration'' by Christy and Fowler, may be deformed and is suspected to have a shape like a line of four alpha particles. Also, a rotation-like series of levels with spins and parities, 0^+, 1^-, 2^+, 3^-, and 4^+ among the highly excited states of Mg^24 which appears to correspond to a series expected for a linear rotator with six alpha particles in a line is discussed. With Ne^20, indications of medium-deformed states are found. Analogous discussions on the levels in Be^8 and C^12 are tried although the experimental evidence is less conclusive.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: An experimental study of excitation probabilities of rotational states with spins 2, 4, 6, and 8 in 22 even-even nuclei in the region 150 &le; A &le; 192 has been carried out by means of multiple Coulomb excitation with oxygen ions of energies up to 44 MeV. In the region of strong nuclear deformation, the results are in good agreement with excitation probabilities calculated on the basis of the rotational model. It has, however, been observed, that the intrinsic quadrupole moment Q_0, derived from the observed excitation probabilities, increases for higher rotational states, especially in the transition region. For Sm^152, the dependence of the probabilities for excitation of the 2^+ and 4^+ states on the bombarding energy are compared with calculations based on higher order perturbation theory and on multiple Coulomb-excitation theory. In the nuclei Sm^152, Gd^160, W^186, Os^188, and Os^192, nonrotational transitions were observed. The excitation probabilities of the second excited 2^+ states are compared with the predictions of the Davydov model.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: By use of the universal scattering cross section derived by Lindhard et al., the velocity of an ion in a scattering medium is calculated as a function of time. The effect of both electronic and atomic collisions is included. In addition, the average scattering angle (in the lab system) resulting from multiple atomic collisions is derived. It is shown that in most cases the attenuation of the Doppler shift as a result of the changed direction of the scattered nucleus is more important than the effect of slowing down due to atomic collisions. In fact, at low velocities and for heavy scatterers the change in the direction of motion is the dominating factor. The results are given in a form amenable to numerical analysis. In the limiting cases of (i) very short lifetimes and (ii) predominantly electronic scattering, the average Doppler shifts are given in an analytical form.</td>

The angular distributions are found to be perturbed by strong hyperfine fields generated by the highly ionized atoms.

In gas, the fluctuations in the field direction are due to collisions (at the rate of about 2 &times; 10^13&nbsp;sec^-1 at atmospheric pressure), and in vacuum they are brought about by optical transitions (at a rate of about 3 &times; 10^11&nbsp;sec^-1).

Together with previously determined branching ratios, these data are used to obtain lifetimes of the levels, which are compared with directly measured lifetimes. The Doppler-shift method is used to determine the lifetimes of the 367 and 707 keV levels of ^57Fe and the 847 keV level of ^56Fe. The magnetic moment of the 136 keV level of ^57Fe is determined by an integral-precession measurement in an external field. An attempt is made to observe the magnetic moment of the 367 keV state following implantation in an iron environment. All the properties of the levels in ^57Fe are compared with recent theories.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Low-lying nuclear spectra ubiquitously exhibit features characteristic of collective modes of motion. It is thus interesting to try to describe nuclear properties using only a few collective degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, the separation of a few collective degrees of freedom from a many fermion system is a difficult theoretical problem. Obviously it is unreasonable to expect a complete description of the low-lying spectral properties using only collective degrees of freedom. In spite of this, it is still very useful to ascertain to what extent it is possible to describe nuclear properties using a phenomenological collective model since this can give a clear insight into the structure of a complex system.</td>

Strong correlations between protons and neutrons break down the pairing scheme and lower the first J = 2 levels in doubly even nuclei, which is shown from the resultant wave functions. A relation between the shell model and collective rotational model is discussed concerning the calculated rotation-like spectrum of ^56Fe.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The nuclear spectra of ^54,56,58Fe and ^58,60,62Ni are obtained by mixing various bands. The bands for each nucleus are obtained by considering the prolate and oblate Hartree-Fock solutions. The third band is obtained by considering two-particle-two-hole excitations on whichever is the lower solution of the above two. The states with definite angular momenta are projected and the orthogonalization is carried out to obtain the nuclear spectra. The Yukawa-Rosenfeld interaction (YR) and the Kuo-Brown interaction modified by McGrory et al. (KM) are used as the two-body interactions. The single particle energies are varied for each mucleus to give a good fit. A comparison between the interactions shows that the KM interaction for the Fe isotopes and the YR interaction for the Ni isotopes give better results. In general, the agreement with the experimental spectra is very good. However, the second 2^+ state in ^56,58Fe and ^60Ni cannot be explained by this model which considers only K = 0$ bands. The high spin states have also been obtained. The effects of the band mixing on the nuclear spectra are discussed in detail for each nucleus.</td>

The ranges of applicability of each method and the relationships between the methods are discussed with particular emphasis placed on distinguishing between the cases for which the magnitudes of variances on the input data are known and those for which they are not known. It is shown directly that the graphical _min^2 + 1 rule is equivalent to the analytic internal error estimates and the corresponding graphical limit for the external error estimates is given by $_min^2[1 + (1(n-p))F_&infin;(1,n-p)]. An explicit formula is given for transforming from one error estimate to another. A direct analytic procedure is presented for determining the diagonal elements of the error matrix without calculating or inverting the normal matrix. Tables of the statistical F and t distributions at the 68.3% and 95.5% confidence levels are also given. A simulation of a simple fitting experiment is discussed to clarify the concepts involved.</td>

A shell-model study has also been carried out in which the protons are constrained to the f_7/2 shell while valence neutrons are restricted to the f_5/2-p_3/2-p_1/2 subgroup.

The linear motion for the adjustment of the target-stopper distance is provided by two independent sources: a micrometer for distances above 15&nbsp;&mu;m and a piezocrystal for distances below that value. During measurement the distance is regulated by a phase comparison of the oscillator frequency determined by the target-stopper capacity with the frequency of a reference source. The performance of the plunger device and the regulation is demonstrated by measuring the life-times of some levels in ^41K and ^41Ca with the reaction ^27Al(^16O, np&gamma;)^41Ca at 34&nbsp;MeV.</td>

States decaying by converted transitions lead to highly charged recoil ions as a result of fast Auger cascades in the atomic shells. The high charges are reset to the equilibrium value by traversing a thin carbon coil. The lifetimes are determined by measuring the intensity ratio of high and low charge recoil ions as a function of the target-carbon foil distance. An interesting application of this new technique is the lifetime measurement of rotational states in the second minimum of actinide nuclei.</td>

The calculations of E2 observables are in reasonable agreement with experiment when added effective charges of 1.0e are used for both neutrons and protons. The neutron effective charge is significantly different from one appropriate (1.9e) for ^56Ni. There is a strong state dependence in the effective M1 operator, and calculations of M1 observables are in general disagreement with experiment. An analysis of the structure of ground-state bands and yrast levels is made in terms of a simple rotational model. In all even isotopes, the intrinsic quadrupole moments in the ground-state "band" shrink dramatically with increasing J. There is evidence of a band crossing in all three even isotopes, but no evidence is found for an abrupt shape change in the ground-state bands of these nuclei. It is concluded that no simple rotational model gives a good description of the low-lying states of the iron isotopes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Shape coexistence in odd-mass nuclei near closed shells (1 and 3) is reviewed. Two main approaches are presented. The more historical one starts from the explicit introduction of a deformation degree of freedom and allows particular Nilsson orbitals to occur very low in excitation energy. A second approach starts from spherical particle-hole (p-h) excitations across a closed shell and allows interaction with quadrupole vibrations of the underlying core nucleus. The equivalence between the two approaches is discussed in some detail. Attention is given also to other approaches to the description of coexistence. A detailed review of the experimental evidence for coexistence in odd-mass nuclei near the Z = 28, 50, 82 and N = 28, 50, 82 closed shells is made. In addition, the fingerprints of coexisting states, i.e. the most pronounced nuclear structure properties characterizing such states, are presented. These fingerprints provide a necessary (though not sufficient) set of conditions for identifying coexistence throughout the nuclear mass table. At the end, we briefly describe the connection of the present study to other areas of nuclear structure such as related configurations in doubly-even nuclei, many-particle many-hole excitations, deep-lying hole states, and the possibility of incorporating these degrees of freedom into an Interacting Boson Approximation (IBA) framework. A major conclusion of this review is that there is a clear conncection between shape coexistence and shell-model intruder states. A variety of topics is suggested for future experimental and theoretical investigation.</td>

For bombarding energies well below the Coulomb barrier, the colliding nuclei remain sufficiently far apart to ensure that the finite-range nuclear interaction is insignificant and thus the interaction is dominated by the well-known electromagnetic force. The importance of Coulomb excitation lies in the fact that the theory is well understood, allowing for quantitative studies of nuclear structure unimpeded by uncertainties in our knowledge of the interaction and reaction mechanism that plague many other spectroscopic probes emplyed in nuclear science.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Transient-field precessions were measured for levels in ^197Au and ^182,184,186W as their ions simultaneously traversed polarized Gd hosts. Gyromagnetic ratios were inferred for the positive-parity levels between, and including, the lowest 5/2^+ and 11/2^+ states in ^197Au. Lifetimes of several levels were determined using the Doppler-broadened lineshape technique, and multipole mixing ratios of a number of transitions were deduced from measured particle-&gamma;-ray angular correlations. The measured static and dynamic electromagnetic moments are compared with the predictions of the weak-coupling core-excitation model and with those of the interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM), including its Spin(6) supersymmetry limit.</td>

The DDCM can be used for singles as well as for coincidence plunger data and systematic errors can be discovered with it much easier than in the conventional analysis. In addition we propose a modification of the normal plunger which we call the differential plunger. With the differential plunger in principle it is possible to determine lifetimes from quantities measured at only one target to stopper distance. The DDCM was tested with lifetime data for ^120Xe and ^128Ba.</td>

The first is essentially the shell model with the excitation of pairs of protons and/or neutrons across closed shells or subshells together with a residual proton-neutron interaction. The second is the deformed mean-field approach. The first is broadly defined so that it includes various truncation schemes to the shell model including generalized seniority and the interacting boson model. The presentation of the theory has two main aims: to provide a framework into which the majority of theoretical studies of shape coexistence can be placed and to provide a framework within which a unified view can be discussed. Selected experimental data are shown from ^16O to ^238U. Our criteria for selection emphasize detailed spectroscopic evidence (``fingerprints'') for coexisting shapes.</td>

An extension of this method for the analysis of Doppler-shift attenuation method (DSAM) measurements both in singles and coincidence mode is worked out. Improvements are expected for detecting and avoiding systematic errors which are likely to appear in the analysis of DSAM data. The application of the DDCM to DSAM coincidence measurements would solve problems associated with observed and unobserved feeding and their time behavior.

Twelve of these nuclei are relatively well fitted and present level patterns in accordance to the model predictions. They are thus confirmed or possible U(5) nuclei. The analysis suggests that they present extensive multiphonon structures. This implies the survival of such structures at higher energies. The experimental B(E2) values between multiphonon states are shown to agree with the finite N dependence predicted by the IBM. It is also observed that the 2_1^+ energies are quite generally about 15% lower than expected from the global nuclear properties.</td>

Energy spectra, electromagnetic transitions and moments as well as beta decay properties are computed and compared with the experiment and with the results of the earlier interactions.

The semimagic structure is successfully described for N or Z = 28 nuclei, ^53Mn, ^54Fe, ^55Co, and ^56,57,58,59Ni, suggesting the existence of significant core excitations in low-lying nonyrast states as well as in high spin yrast states. The results of N = Z odd-odd nuclei, ^54Co and ^58Cu, also confirm the reliability of GXPF1 interaction in the isospin dependent properties. Studies of shape coexistence suggest an advantage of Monte Carlo shell model over conventional calculations in cases where full-space calculations still remain too large to be practical.</td>

The default ICC table, based on the Dirac–Fock calculations using the so called “Frozen Orbital” approximation, takes into account the effect of atomic vacancies created in the conversion process. The table has been calculated for all atomic shells and to cover transition energies of 1–6000 keV and atomic numbers of Z = 5–110. The software tools presented here are well suited for basic nuclear structure research and for a range of applications.</td>

Currently, more than 700 scientific citations are made to SRIM every year. For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the SRIM package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 27,000 experimental data points.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Shape coexistence in nuclei appears to be unique in the realm of finite many-body quantum systems. It differs from the various geometrical arrangements that sometimes occur in a molecule in that in a molecule the various arrangements are of the widely separated atomic nuclei. In nuclei the various “arrangements” of nucleons involve (sets of) energy eigenstates with different electric quadrupole properties such as moments and transition rates, and different distributions of proton pairs and neutron pairs with respect to their Fermi energies. Sometimes two such structures will “invert” as a function of the nucleon number, resulting in a sudden and dramatic change in ground-state properties in neighboring isotopes and isotones. In the first part of this review the theoretical status of coexistence in nuclei is summarized. Two approaches, namely, microscopic shell-model descriptions and mean-field descriptions, are emphasized. The second part of this review presents systematic data, for both even- and odd-mass nuclei, selected to illustrate the various ways in which coexistence is observed in nuclei. The last part of this review looks to future developments and the issue of the universality of coexistence in nuclei. Surprises continue to be discovered. With the major advances in reaching to extremes of proton-neutron number, and the anticipated new “rare isotope beam” facilities, guidelines for search and discovery are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this article, the Recoil Distance Doppler-Shift (RDDS) method which is extensively used in nuclear structure physics to determine level lifetimes and absolute transition probabilities is reviewed. Especially, it is aimed to present new developments and variants of the technique which have evolved mainly in the past 25 years. After a short and comprehensive description of the basic elements of the plunger technique, the new variants are presented. This comprises the RDDS technique using &gamma;&gamma;-coincidences, RDDS measurements in combination with particle detectors for selecting specific reaction channels, RDDS after Coulomb excitation, RDDS after fission and RDDS using a gas target. In addition, the concept of a differential plunger is discussed with respect to its specific features and typical experimental setups. Examples of differential plunger measurements with recoil tagging, recoil decay tagging and after deep inelastic reactions, Coulomb excitation in inverse reaction kinematics as well as after reactions with fast radioactive beams at energies of 50–100 MeV/u are given. The second focus of the review is dedicated to today’s plunger devices and related hardware. The concepts of specific plunger devices which accommodate the specific demands of the aforementioned RDDS applications including specific feedback systems for controlling target–stopper/degrader separations in-beam are presented. Also discussed are target and stopper/degrader foil related issues like foil preparation, mounting and stretching as well as specific features of the foil behavior in-beam (temperature, blistering, wrinkling and carbon build-up). The third focus is devoted to the data analysis. The concept of the Differential Decay Curve Method (DDCM) is presented as an alternative approach for the analysis of RDDS data measured as singles or as &gamma;&gamma;-coincidences. For the latter, different gating possibilities are discussed, e.g. gating from above and gating from below the level of interest and gating on fractional components. Finally, the simulation of line-shapes and its application is presented.</td>

An electronic feedback system keeping the distance between target and stopper foils constant, imperative for precision measurements of short lifetimes, was also developed.<p>The plunger device was commissioned with an experiment performed at the IPN Orsay Tandem accelerator laboratory using the Orgam germanium detector array. Excited states in ^76Kr were populated using the reaction ^45Sc(^35Cl,2p2n)^76Kr. The lifetime &tau; of the state was determined to 4.3(6) ps, in accordance with previous measurement, confirming the functionality of the new plunger device. The commissioning experiment showed in particular that the electronic feed back system works as foreseen.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A new plunger device has been designed and built to measure the lifetimes of unbound states in exotic nuclei beyond the proton drip-line. The device has been designed to work in both vacuum and dilute-gas environments made possible through the introduction of a low-voltage stepping motor. DPUNS will be used in conjunction with the gas-filled separator RITU and the vacuum separator MARA at the accelerator laboratory of the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, to measure the lifetimes of excited states with low population cross-sections. This is achieved by eliminating the need for a carbon foil to isolate the helium gas of RITU from the beam line thus reducing the background from beam-foil reactions. The inclusion of a high-sampling rate data acquisition card increases further the sensitivity of the device. The plunger will be used to address many key facets of nuclear structure physics with particular emphasis on the effect of deformation on proton emission rates.</td>

The energy loss of the nickel beams through the carbon target were directly measured with a zero-degree Bragg detector and the absolute B(E2) values were normalized by Rutherford scattering. The B(E2) values disagree with recent lifetime studies that employed the Doppler-shift attenuation method. The present high-precision B(E2) values reveal an asymmetry about ^62Ni, midshell between N=28 and 40, with larger values towards ^56Ni (Z = N = 28). The experimental B(E2) values are compared with shell-model calculations in the full pf model space and the results indicate a soft ^56Ni core.</td>

In this paper we study the development of collectivity along the chromium and iron isotopic chains. The calculations are performed within two different perspectives, namely, the proton-neutron interacting boson model (IBM-2) and interacting shell model (ISM) and compared with the available experimental data. The onset of collectivity is studied through nuclear quantities and observables that suggest differences in the nuclear structure of Cr and Fe isotopical chains. Furthermore, a prediction for the shape transition from a spherical vibrator to &gamma;-soft rotor with nucleus ^58Cr standing at the critical point is discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Precession of aligned nuclear spin systems in ions recoiling from the target into vacuum (RIV) with consequent attenuation of angular distributions of emitted radiation is, in principle, a versatile method for measurement of g-factors of nuclear excited states of lifetimes in the pico-second range (Stone et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 94, 192501, 2005 and Stuchbery and Stone, Phys. Rev. C, 76, 034307, 2007). Calibration of the observed attenuations has been achieved in favourable cases through comparison with measurements on states having previously known g-factors and lifetimes. The general lack of suitable states with known g-factors has limited application of the RIV method. This paper concerns the present status of efforts to describe the states of excited ions recoiling into vacuum in detail so that the average interaction can be estimated with useful precision from a-priori theory. The calculations use the GRASP2K package (Froese-Fischer et al. 1997 and Jonsson, Comp. Phys. Comm., 177, 597, 2007 &amp;amp; 184, 2197, 2013) to obtain, for each recoiling ion change state, the individual possible electronic states, their configurations, lifetimes and hyperfine interactions. It is assumed that all possible ionic states are produced, up to a chosen excitation energy. This energy is selected to approximate the energy at which all states have lifetimes far shorter than the nuclear state of interest. It is further assumed that the ionic state total electron angular momenta are randomly oriented in space. The first estimates of the average attenuation of emission distributions, as a function of the product g&tau; of the nuclear state g-factor and mean lifetime, used an averaged precession frequency obtained neglecting transitions between electronic states. Improved calculations, which include such transitions, are described.</td>

Evidence for triaxiality and shape coexistence, based on the model-independent shape invariants deduced from the Kumar–Cline sum rule, is presented. These are interpreted using a simple two-state mixing model as well as multi-state mixing calculations carried out within the framework of the triaxial rotor model.

The evidence for the presence of shape coexistence in the Z = 50 region, at low spin and low excitation energies, will be presented and clued for the microscopic origin explored.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: With the recent advances in radioactive ion beam technology, Coulomb excitation at safe energies becomes an important experimental tool in nuclear-structure physics. The usefulness of the technique to extract key information on the electromagnetic properties of nuclei has been demonstrated since the 1960s with stable beam and target combinations. New challenges present themselves when studying exotic nuclei with this technique, including dealing with low statistics or number of data points, absolute and relative normalisation of the measured cross-sections and a lack of complementary experimental data, such as excited-state lifetimes and branching ratios. This paper addresses some of these common issues and presents analysis techniques to extract transition strengths and quadrupole moments utilising the least-squares fit code, GOSIA.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Low-energy collectivity of nuclei has been, and is being, characterized in a critical manner using data from a variety of spectroscopic methods, including Coulomb excitation, &beta; decay, inelastic scattering of charged and uncharged particles, transfer reactions, etc. In addition to level energies and spins, transition multipolarities and intensities, lifetimes, and nuclear moments are available. The totality of information from these probes must be considered in achieving an accurate vision of the excitations in nuclei and determining the applicability of nuclear models. From these data, major changes in our view of low-energy collectivity in nuclei have emerged; most notable is the demise of the long-held view of low-energy quadrupole collectivity near closed shells as due to vibrations about a spherical equilibrium shape. In this contribution, we focus on the basic predictions of the spherical harmonic vibrator limit of the Bohr Hamiltonian. Properties such as B(E2) values, quadrupole moments, E0 strengths, etc are outlined. Using the predicted properties as a guide, evidence is cited for and against the existence of vibrational states, and especially multi-phonon states, in nuclei that are, or historically were considered to be, spherical or have a nearly spherical shape in their ground state. It is found that very few of the nuclei that were identified in the last major survey seeking nearly spherical harmonic vibrators satisfy the more stringent guidelines presented herein. Details of these fundamental shifts in our view of low-energy collectivity in nuclei are presented.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The present Grasp2018 is an updated Fortran 95 version of the recommended block versions of programs from Grasp2K Version 1_1 for large-scale calculations Jönsson et al. (2013). MPI programs are included so that all major tasks can be executed using parallel computers. Tools have been added that simplify the generation of configuration state function expansions for the multireference single- and double computational model. Names of programs have been changed to accurately reflect the task performed by the code. Modifications to the relativistic self-consistent field program have been made that, in some instances, greatly reduce the number of iterations needed for determining the requested eigenvalues and the memory required. Changes have been made to the relativistic configuration interaction program to substantially cut down on the time for constructing the Hamiltonian matrix for configuration state function expansions based on large orbital sets. In the case of a finite nucleus the grid points have been changed so that the first non-zero point is Z-dependent as for the point nucleus. A number of tools have been developed to generate LaTeX tables of eigenvalue composition, energies, transition data and lifetimes. Tools for plotting and analyzing computed properties along an iso-electronic sequence have also been added. A number of minor errors have been corrected. A detailed manual is included that describes different aspects of the package as well as the steps needed in order to produce reliable results.</td>

The transition rates determined from the measured branching ratios and level lifetimes obtained with the Doppler-shift attenuation method following inelastic neutron scattering reveal collective enhancements that are suggestive of a series of rotational bands. In ^110Cd, a &gamma; band built on the shape-coexisting intruder configuration is suggested. For ^112Cd, the 2^+ and 3^+ intruder &gamma;-band members are suggested, the 0_3^+ band is extended to spin 4^+, and the 0_4^+ band is identified. The results are interpreted using beyond-mean-field calculations employing the symmetry conserving configuration mixing method with the Gogny D1S energy density functional and with the suggestion that the Cd isotopes exhibit multiple shape coexistence.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A charge plunger device has been commissioned based on the DPUNS plunger (Taylor et al., 2013) using the in-flight mass separator MARA at the University of Jyväskylä. The ^152Sm(^32S,4n)^180Pt reaction was used to populate excited states in 180. A lifetime measurement of the 2_1^+ state was performed by applying the charge plunger technique, which relies on the detection of the charge state-distribution of recoils rather than the detection of the emitted &gamma; rays. This state was a good candidate to test the charge plunger technique as it has a known lifetime and depopulates through a converted transition that competes strongly with &gamma;-ray emission. The lifetime of the 2_1^+ state was measured to be 480(10)&nbsp;ps, which is consistent with previously reported lifetimes that relied on the standard &gamma;-ray techniques. The charge plunger technique is a complementary approach to lifetime measurements of excited states that depopulate through both &gamma;-ray emission and internal conversion. In cases where it is not possible to detect Doppler-shifted &gamma; rays, for example, in heavy nuclei where internal conversion dominates, it may well be the only feasible lifetime analysis approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Excited-state lifetimes were measured by direct fast-timing methods in three N = 125 isotones — ^209Po, ^211Rn, and ^213Ra — near doubly magic ^208Pb. These nuclei have a single neutron hole and successively add pairs of protons relative to ^208Pb. The first-excited state to ground-state transition, 5/2_1^- to 1/2_1^- , has almost identical energy in each isotone and can be associated with the single neutron-hole transition &nu; f_5/2^-1 to &nu; p_1/2^-1. The extent to which the protons act as spectators is assessed based on the measured transition rates, which show a systematic increase along the isotone chain, and by comparisons with large-basis shell-model calculations. The shell model accounts for some of the increased transition strength but consistently underestimates the experimental values. It also fails to explain the near-constant transition energies. These results suggest emerging collectivity beyond the shell-model valence space and show that the near-constant transition energies are not a consequence of a pure neutron-hole transition, but rather the outcome of complex nucleon-nucleon correlations that increase quadrupole collectivity.</td>

It is shown how these uncertainties arise when the capacitance method is used to determine absolute distances and how they influence the obtained lifetime values of a plunger experiment. Furthermore, a new approach to obtain absolute foil separations for plunger measurements using a high precision optical distance probe is introduced, which can reduce these uncertainties by a large margin. The performance of this method is demonstrated by comparisons to the capacitance method as well as to a precise measurement of absolute distances using known lifetimes in ^181Ta.</td>

In this work, we provide an overview of the experimental investigations of shape coexistence, focusing on those regions of the nuclear chart that have been the most actively investigated within the past decade. In particular, we focus on coexistence phenomena at low angular momentum and on the new experimental information, placed within the context of previous results. We first give a summary of the experimental signatures that can be used for assessing shape coexistence, and then discuss the evidence for shape coexistence from experimental results, with particular attention paid to regions where its presence has been suggested along isotopic or isotonic chains, and in regions where "islands" of such structures have been proposed. We conclude with an overview, with an emphasis on the emerging regions where indications for multiple shape coexistence exist.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The present review takes steps from the domain of the shell model into open shell nuclei. The question posed in the title is to dramatize how far shell model approaches, i.e., many nucleons occupying independent-particle configurations and interacting through two-body forces (a configuration interaction problem) can provide a description of nuclei as one explores the structure observed where neither proton nor neutron numbers match closed shells. Features of doubly closed and singly closed shell nuclei and adjacent nuclei are sketched, together with the roles played by seniority, shape coexistence, triaxial shapes and particle–core coupling in organizing data. An illuminating step is taken here to provide a detailed study the reduced transition rates, B(E2; 2_1^+ to 0_1^+), in the singly closed shell nuclei with doubly closed shell plus or minus a pair of identical nucleons, and the confrontation between such data and state-of-the-art shell model calculations: this amounts to a review of the effective charge problem. The results raise many questions and point to the need for much further work. Some guidance on criteria for sharpening the division between the domain of the shell model and that of deformation-based descriptions of nuclei are provided. The paper is closed with a sketch of a promising direction in terms of the algebraic structure embodied in the symplectic shell model.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We report on the development of a custom particle detection system that aims to improve the detection capabilities of the ROSPHERE array. The detector is designed specifically for lifetime measurements using the in-beam Fast-timing method for nuclear states in nuclides produced in nuclear transfer reactions. An 80 &times; 3.6&nbsp;mm disc of BC400 plastic scintillator was coupled to a sparse SiPM array readout connected to a dedicated Front End Electronics board. The detector was tested versus a conical LaBr_3(Ce) coupled to a Hamamatsu PMT readout. The timing measurements resulted in a resolution of 896(5)&nbsp;ps. The detector design, characteristics, and performances are presented in this paper along with future improvements.</td>
